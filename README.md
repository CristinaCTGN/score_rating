# score_rating
We will have a function that will convert a group of scores given in any type of data, into a rating, depending on the mean of all the scores given.
This is an example of the "Introduction to Python Programming" Udacity's MOOC. The first commit is not original of mine, but most of it is the guided developing from the MOOC.
I will try to make an attempt to change it somewhat.
